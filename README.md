# Minecraft Server Front End - Built with Vite + TS + React + SWC
Small front end built for a weekend project architected on AWS as a backend. Utilises my custom component library to build a robust UI for interacting with my small-scale beta Minecraft server, leverages some other technology such as Java plug ins and Bash to drive the real time data and interactivity!
